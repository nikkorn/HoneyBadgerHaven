        <h2>Mating, Hugs and Kisses</h2>
        <p>Honey badger reproduction revolves around "Honey-Valentines Day" where the male honey-badger tries to attract a mate using a heart-shaped honey-comb confectionary.</p>
        <p>Honey-Valentines day happens once every 13th day, unless that day is a thursday or bank-holiday, in which case a notification will be sent out on badger-mail informing everyone of the new date.</p>
        <p>Nobody knows what happens once a honey badger has found a mate as they always ask for privacy.</p>

        <h2>Gestation</h2>
        <p>The gestation period for honey badgers is shared between the mother and father.</p>
        <p>A female honey badger is pregnant for the first 3 months of the pregnancy. She then hands the cub over to the father who is pregnant for a 2 week period to give the mother a break. Pregnancy is then passed back to the mother for the final 3 months.</p>
        <p>In an interview with CNN one father honey badger said "Being pregnant was a good laugh but I wouldn't want to do it all the time".</p>

        <p>Their young are born fully clothed but completely blind. They remain blind until the age of 3 days, at which point the parent will utter the secret sight giving phrase and send the cub off to fend for itself.</p>
