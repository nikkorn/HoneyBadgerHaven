      <ul>
        <li>Every male Honey Badger is named Jimbob. No one can remember why.</li>
        <li>Female Honey Badgers are either named Sheila or Shayla. Given the wide range of Honey Badger accents, it is often difficult to work out which one was said.</li>
        <li>Honey Badgers prefer honey from bees that have visited daisies. One suggested reason why is that the taste of the daisy reminds them of the good old times.</li>
        <li>Honey Badges hate laptops from HP, they would prefer it if the company were called HB.</li>
