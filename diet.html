How Often They Eat

Young honey-badgers (AKA honey-badgettis) frequently snack frequently. It causes their parents a lot of frustation because they fill up on snacks but don't have space for their dinner.

Adult honey-badgers eat only once in their adult life.

How Much They Eat

Honey-badgers eat 1/4 of their body weight at every meal.
